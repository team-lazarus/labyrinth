# Labyrinth
A roguelike game built in Godot 3.5 to train adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) agentsâ€”Daedalus and Theseus. Designed for AI experimentation and adversarial agent training.

## Features
- **Procedural Labyrinth Generation**: Every playthrough presents a new maze.
- **AI Training Environment**: Supports adversarial RL between Daedalus and Theseus.
- **Godot 3.5 Engine**: Lightweight and easy to extend.

## Requirements
- [Godot 3.5 (Stable)](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.5-stable/)

## Setup

2. **Import the project**:

## Running the RL Agent
1. Clone and set up the [Theseus repository](https://github.com/team-lazarus/theseus):
